Problem Statement In traditional restaurant settings, manual ordering processes can be slow and prone to calculation errors, leading to customer dissatisfaction and revenue loss. There is a need for a digital solution that streamlines the ordering process, ensures accurate billing, and enhances the overall customer experience by providing instant feedback on pricing and availability.

Scope of the Project The scope of this project is limited to a command-line interface (CLI) simulation of a restaurant's front-end ordering system. It covers the display of a static menu, the acceptance of user input for multiple items, and the generation of a final bill. It does not currently include backend database connectivity, payment gateway integration, or kitchen order management.
